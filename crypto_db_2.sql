You can use it to buy things online, and you can send it instantly to other users anywhere in the world, at very low cost, needing nothing more than a smartphone and an internet connection.\r\n\r\nCryptocurrency can be cheaper and more convenient than many existing services like Paypal or Transferwise, if - for example - you regularly send money overseas. Several million people are actively using it today for that purpose.\r\n\r\nWorthwhile as that is, it isn’t what’s drawing people’s attention\r\n\r\nAs well as functioning as a new type of internet money, cryptocurrency is also a very popular form of investment, with eye-popping long-term appreciation. \r\n\r\n    €60,000,000\r\n\r\n    What €1 invested in 2009 in Bitcoin is worth in 2021\r\n\r\nNewcomers to cryptocurrency find this aspect very confusing.

Why achieving digital scarcity is such a big deal \r\n\r\nIn the previous article, you learned the definition and basic characteristics of a cryptocurrency - including the distinction between the money and the money system, and the role of cryptography. \r\n\r\nYou also had a brief intro to the history and evolution of money up until Bitcoin. This should have given you a grasp on how cryptocurrencies - despite being entirely digital - can have value, the origins of the term “gold standard”, and the basic properties of what makes for sound money: durability, divisibility, fungibility, portability, recognisability and scarcity.\r\n\r\nWhile all forms of digital currency satisfy the first five reasonably well, it turns out it’s surprisingly hard to impose scarcity on any digital thing. This is crucially important because value comes from scarcity. Imagine if gold was as common as sand, or Da Vinci had produced 1 million exact copies of the Mona Lisa.\r\n\r\nThe absence of digital scarcity is the biggest weakness of existing money; achieving it was arguably the biggest challenge for cryptocurrency. Explaining both, is our challenge here, and it begins by talking about the importance of money holding value.'),

To this day, nobody knows (at least publicly) who Satoshi Nakamoto is - and that’s arguably their biggest legacy to the community.\r\n\r\nBy vanishing into the ether soon after Bitcoin was robust enough, Nakamoto has done away with the first central point of failure.\r\n\r\nIf gold had been “invented” by someone, that person would arguably hold great influence over their invention. If, moreover, that someone had kept a key that allowed them to control the gold economy, they would wield an ungodly amount of power. \r\n\r\nThey would also be vulnerable to pleas, bribes, legal action, punches in the face, and otherwise strong pressure to tweak their invention to benefit one party or another - perhaps a government, or the mafia. Either way, the entire system would be vulnerable at a central point.

Its creator was Satoshi Nakamoto - publishing its blueprint in 2008.\r\n4. How Bitcoin works to achieve a digitally scarce form of money.\r\n\r\nThe achievements of Bitcoin’s creator will likely be considered as important as the invention of the internet or personal computer. Not simply a new form of money, but an entirely new way of thinking about money. \r\n\r\nAs ingenious as the Bitcoin whitepaper was, it wasn’t perfect. \r\n\r\nThis problem is known as the Bitcoin trilemma; how to achieve the three core functions of an ideal cryptocurrency:\r\n\r\n1. Security - Can it provide a secure, trustworthy & reliable monetary system \r\n2. Scalability - Can it support increasing numbers of users with no compromise on speed or convenience?\r\n3. Decentralisation - Can it continue to function without a central point of control.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding this trilemma will give you a better appreciation of the problems Bitcoin solves, as well as those things it isn’t an ideal solution for. \r\n\r\nThis can then put into context the projects and innovations that have emerged in response to the perceived shortcomings, which fall into one of three distinct groups:\r\n\r\n- Change the rules\r\n- Build on top\r\n- Build an alternative/sacrifice one of the pillars\r\n\r\nOne of the most commonly discussed weaknesses, is that in order to create a new form of scarce internet money, with no controlling authority, Satoshi Nakamoto had to prioritise design features that make Bitcoin unsuitable for low value, high frequency transactions.

The consequences for holders of a forked cryptocurrency\n\nEvery now and then, you get a notification from your mobile bank app telling you to download an update, which may include bug fixes, improvements, and new features.\n\nUpdates of this type aren’t very controversial, since you don’t really have any influence over the changes. And if you refuse Barclay’s most recent update, you’ll soon start having security issues, or the app may just stop working.\n\nBut when it comes to updating cryptocurrencies, things aren’t that simple. In contrast to your banking app, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are open source and decentralised; so there is no ultimate decision maker.,  \n\nOpen source literally means that anyone can legally copy the computer code and repurpose it, making whatever changes they see fit.\n\nThis means that if a change to Bitcoin was proposed for which there wasn’t a consensus - an agreement - there is always the risk that someone will be determined enough to literally take the project in a new direction, by creating a fork.\n\nSo a fork is essentially what happens when a consensus can’t be reached about improving a blockchain’s design and function. It is a change in the design of a blockchain creating two paths, one of which nodes and miners need to choose, like meeting a fork in a road and deciding which route to take.\n\nFor a very simple analogy, think about your favourite band splitting - because of creative differences - and forming two separate groups.\n\nJust as a band has different roles, so does a cryptocurrency; let’s meet them.'),

Read this chapter first if you need to get up to speed.\n\nEconomic incentives are central to how cryptocurrencies can function without a central point of control. The novel use of incentives also extends to how crypto projects attract new users, how those who own cryptocurrency are rewarded for retaining them, and the ways with which you can speculate with, and about the value of, crypto.\n\nThese three categories can be summarised as:\n\n* Earning by Learning\n* Earning by Stacking\n* Earning by Speculating\n\nThese themes cover the full spectrum of ways to earn cryptocurrency. What distinguishes them is risk, reward and effort, which have incorporated into a helpful infographic.\n\nWe’ll use these three measures as yardsticks for you to evaluate the kinds of opportunities out there to earn cryptocurrency, but with the greatest emphasis on measuring risk. \n\nAs a newcomer, understanding the risks involved, both explicit and implicit, is crucial. You cannot get something for nothing, and any opportunity that seems too good to be true, almost certainly is.\n\nThat being said, incentives - where you are compensated in crypto - are one of the main methods crypto projects use to attract new users. This is often simply in exchange for your attention, your time learning about a product or project, as well as promoting to others, the benefits of a new cryptocurrency. Some incentives even reward you for using or interacting with the project or crypto itself.\n\nThese things don’t require any up-front cost but understanding the implied cost of providing personal details, your time and effort - no matter how little - is crucial to realising that there really is no such thing as free cryptocurrency. \n'),

It is a low-cost and effective alternative to online or TV marketing for a completely new product - putting it directly in the hands of a large number of consumers for free, hoping they like it and will buy it in the future.\r\n\r\nWhen Bitcoin launched - back in 2009 - it faced an extreme challenge in increasing adoption. It wasn’t just new, it was completely different to existing forms of money, had no company or individual behind it you could review, and no marketing budget. \r\n\r\nThere were no cryptocurrency exchanges - the most popular way adoption grows today - so the only way to buy bitcoin was by sending funds to a miner willing to sell some of the coins they had earned as rewards. \r\n\r\nThis was fine if you were comfortable with the risk of sending money to a stranger, but it was clear that in order to grow, Bitcoin needed an easier incentive system to build up its user base.\r\n\r\nIt shouldn’t therefore be a surprise that attempts to spread the word involved putting bitcoin directly in potential users\' hands (virtually speaking) just like the energy bar at a train station; this is how the bitcoin faucet was born.'),

Cryptocurrency is an ideal asset to trade because its short-term price is volatile. In other words, price changes quickly and by significant amounts on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nA volatile asset presents a lot of opportunity for traders who make money by exploiting price movement; but trading cryptocurrency is a double-edged sword. Greater volatility means greater risk, and the risk to a novice trader of losing money is much greater than the chance of making money.\r\n\r\nCryptocurrency is also a novel and relatively immature asset, which means that its true potential over the longer term is especially hard to predict. \r\n\r\nEarly investors have enjoyed astronomical returns, and because adoption is still at a relatively low level, cryptocurrencies still present the possibility for significant returns relative to investment.\r\n\r\nIts novelty - especially in relation to its challenge to traditional forms of money - means its use case and legitimacy in the eyes of governments are unproven, and so there too, lies a lot of risk, to weigh against the opportunity.'),

Trading attempts to profit from short term Technical Analysis; interpreting price movement and volume (we cover Technical Analysis in a separate article).\r\n\r\nInvesting is an attempt to profit from a cryptocurrency\'s  long term success, with the decision making process relying on Fundamental Analysis.\r\n\r\nFundamental Analysis within traditional finance will look at the opportunity to profit by investing in a  company - through both public or private equity - by referring to metrics that describe its financial health and forecast future earnings potential.\r\n\r\nIn relation to publicly traded companies - traded on a stock market - the most common metric is Price to Earnings Ratio (aka PE Ratio). \r\n\r\nPE Ratios are calculated by dividing the Share Price by Earnings Per Share and are a simple yet effective way of estimating whether a company is over or undervalued.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, cryptocurrencies don’t function like traditional companies, with few generating recognisable revenue streams. They also don\'t (in general) raise capital by selling shares, but instead issue their own tokens; the value of those tokens fluctuates in relation to the future potential for revenue generation, as well as perceptions of the intrinsic value of underlying blockchains, networks of participants and users or underlying assets.\r\n\r\nSo any decision around long term investing in cryptocurrency projects, must use a framework that can assess the value of those things, which is what Fundamental Analysis boils down to.\r\n\r\nWhereas Technical Analysis is very prescriptive, Fundamental Analysis within crypto is not just analysing the potential success of a given project but broader socio-economic change, which requires more lateral thinking and some creativity. \r\n\r\nAs daunting as that might sound, when looking at a specific cryptocurrency project, you should always start with some simple, but fundamental questions.'),

The rules that define how Bitcoin works as a monetary system, delivered as a piece of software and a hierarchy of network participants who run it.\n\nIn this article we’ll flesh out more details of the essential system functions and then look at the first of the network participants - a Full Node. Full Nodes play a crucial role in fulfilling Bitcoin’s core functions and enabling others to connect to the network.'),

(2, 'Step 1: Crypto Basics', 'What is cryptocurrency?', 'Into The Time Tunnel', 'Archaeologists have found evidence of collectible items going back 75,000 years, such as beads and pierced animal teeth. Their choice wasn’t random; they were durable, not particularly abundant and clearly had special value (often used as jewellery) and we know they took a lot of effort to make at a time when life was short and energy at a premium.\r\n\r\nThese collectibles were passed on as a family heirloom or as part of important ceremonies as their durability and scarcity enabled them to act as a store of value and a precursor to money.\r\n\r\nWhen our ancestors stopped being nomadic, and developed specialist skills, they were able to exchange their surpluses. On a small scale, a village for example, they could keep a mental note of who owed what - a credit or trust based system - and what a fair exchange rate was - how much wheat in exchange for a cow.\r\n\r\nThis credit system became less useful as the number of items being exchanged increased, and the two sides of the exchanging weren’t local, so credit on trust wasn\'t practical; the solution was to find something suitable as a universal medium of exchange for goods and services; early collectibles were natural candidates and thus became the first money.', 1),
(3, 'Step 1: Crypto Basics', 'What is cryptocurrency?', 'The characteristics of sound money', 'A key property of gold is that it is almost impossible to destroy (durable) but can be melted down into smaller units (divisible), which are relatively easy to transport (portable) and when divided, each unit has identical properties (fungible).\r\n\r\nIt is also very recognisable, which isn\'t surprising as it has intrinsic value due to its colour and shine.\r\n\r\nGold cannot be manufactured, you can only get more of it by digging it out of the ground, but because of the difficulties in mining it, the stock of gold tends to change at a very predictable rate - this gives it the important property of scarcity.\r\n\r\nSo sound money, effective as a medium of exchange or store of value, has these properties:\r\n\r\n- Durable \r\n- Divisibile\r\n- Fungibile\r\n- Portabile\r\n- Recognisable \r\n- Scarce\r\n\r\nThis gives us a good yardstick to measure sound money candidates against, and should help address the question of whether cryptocurrency, as a potential new form of money, has value.\r\n\r\nWhat is important about sound money is that it has a natural evolution. All civilisations independently employed forms of money - varying depending on geography and culture - and all of them, over time, voluntarily gravitated to better (sounder) mediums of exchange or stores of value.\r\n\r\nGold remained the dominant form of money up until the Italian Renaissance (from around 1420) when the one weakness in gold - the difficulty of transporting large amounts - was addressed with the introduction of Paper Notes, redeemable at a bank for the gold it represented.', 1),
(4, 'Step 1: Crypto Basics', 'What is cryptocurrency?', 'The Gold Standard', 'This was the beginning of what we call the “gold standard” - paper money, backed by gold. This continued until 1971, when US President Richard Nixon changed the rules, allowing governments to create money without any mechanism for converting it into an equivalent amount of gold. \r\n\r\nOf course we now know that this breaks one of our golden rules of sound money - scarcity. The new system instead requires us to simply trust our governments to decide how much money should be created and for what purpose. This is known as Fiat Money, which literally means - this is money because the government says its money.\r\n\r\nIn retrospect we should have known that the combination of trust, government and money would end badly.\r\n\r\nThe reason scarcity matters is that creating more money (known as increasing the money supply) makes the money you might have saved worth less; this is called inflation. In countries that totally lose control of their money you get hyperinflation, when your money is worth nothing. \r\n\r\nAs the saying goes, trust comes in on a snail and rides off on a horse, so how do you get back to sound money and regain people’s trust?', 1),

The first and most important cryptocurrency is Bitcoin.', 1),
(6, 'Step 1: Crypto Basics', 'What is cryptocurrency?', 'Bitcoin - Ultimate Sound Money', 'Before we jump down the Bitcoin rabbit hole, let’s make a distinction: Bitcoin (with capital B) refers to its money system - whereas bitcoin (lowercase b) refers to its units - the money itself.\r\n\r\nBitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to find a successful solution that ticks all the boxes of sound money with none of the risks of a single controlling authority. \r\n\r\nLet’s explore how it achieves those two things.', 1),
(7, 'Step 1: Crypto Basics', 'What is cryptocurrency?', 'Achieving Trust', 'By far the most revolutionary aspect of Bitcoin is that it requires exactly zero trust in a central authority - which as we’ve learned, has led to ludicrous national debts driven up by catastrophic financial crises (2008), and the impact of the Covid Pandemic (2020).\r\n\r\nBitcoin solves the trust issue by taking control of the monetary system out of one pair of hands - the central authorities\' - and into many hands of a wide network of dispersed users, none of whom have ultimate control. This is what the term decentralised means.\r\n\r\nOf course Bitcoin did have a creator, (we’ll learn more about them in the next lesson) but the greatest gift they gave was to remain anonymous and relinquish any control, understanding that Bitcoin could only succeed as trusted sound money, controlled by the many, not the few.\r\n\r\nAll these users locally run some software that maintains the Bitcoin network, creating an ongoing consensus of every user’s balance of bitcoin. All Bitcoin transactions are final and can’t be arbitrarily reversed unless all users agree, so as the network grows, it becomes more secure.\r\n\r\nThese users (also known as Nodes) are incentivised to support the network and maintain its accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe use of cryptography secures transactions against fraud and theft, while allowing anyone to mathematically verify the correctness of all transactions in the system.\r\n\r\nYou can’t bribe maths. No matter how much you try to sweet-talk, massage, or threaten an equation, you won’t change its result. So in retrospect, it really shouldn’t be so surprising that maths - combined with computing - was the answer to the problem of trust in the money system.\r\n\r\nBitcoin’s design makes it impossible to freeze, seize, spend someone else’s coins, or to spend the same bitcoin twice. If you try to double-spend your coins, only one of the transactions will go through - any others will fail;\r\n\r\nSo when you want to send 0.5 bitcoin to your friend, you can use a smartphone app, a bit like your personal banking, and the network is incentivised to agree that your balance has 0.5 deducted and your friend, 0.5 bitcoin added.\r\n\r\nUnlike national currencies, Bitcoin is a global money system, recognising no borders. It can be exchanged nearly instantly, at any time. There are no “Bitcoin banking hours” and no KYC.\r\n\r\nBut what about the principles of sound money, I hear you ask? Well Bitcoin has those covered too\r\n\r\n* Scarce - There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin in circulation, and new ones are mined (the process by which new coins are created) at a predictable pace. This means that there won’t ever be a sudden tsunami of new bitcoin flooding the market generating inflation\r\n* Durable - With so many users maintaining the network it would take an unimaginable catastrophe to knock them all out at once.\r\n* Portable - It is just data after all so you can use your phone, a USB device, or even just a QR code on a piece of paper.\r\n* Divisible - Bitcoin has its own special denomination to eight decimal places. Tick.\r\n* Fungible - The beauty of a decentralised system is that no one can make special exemptions*; every Bitcoin is created equal.', 1),

A key difference in the newer forms of digital assets birthed in the years following Bitcoin\'s emergence is that many of them bear very few similarities to Bitcoin in terms of its decentralised nature.\r\n\r\nUnlike Bitcoin, which requires zero trust in a central authority, many cryptocurrencies, tokens, or digital assets actually do rely in varying degrees on central authorities, either to run its operation, or to affect its market value. There are several signs of such cryptocurrencies:\r\n\r\n1. They have a company that issue the cryptocurrency, unlike Bitcoin new coins are supplied through a distributed and decentralised network that anyone can take part in.\r\n2. The network is maintained and secured by a few entities, not at all like Bitcoin which is a public network that anyone can participate in to help secure it.\r\n3. Their developers tend to also be large-scale stakeholders, owning vast amounts of the crypto. These developers also decide what to do with the network, and decide its development journey. Bitcoin\'s governance is decentralised and requires time-consuming consensus processes to agree and implement a new development upgrade.\r\n4.Their operations are not transparent and it is very difficult for the public to see precisely what\'s going on in terms of supply and operations.', 1),

Yes, there are over 1 million active Bitcoin addresses (users) particularly those suffering from the hyperinflation mentioned earlier, which constantly reduces the purchasing power of their existing money and those looking for a strong store of value. (We explain how to measure Bitcoin adoption in a later article).\r\n\r\nHopefully you’ve now understood in basic terms what cryptocurrency is, and how it tries to achieve the function of sound money. As the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin’s design has opened up a new phase in our journey to find the best sound money, and this is just the start.\r\n\r\nYou’ll discover in later lessons how Bitcoin is evolving and as more people understand it, new improvements and refinements are made.\r\n\r\nThe final frontier for bitcoin is volatility. Even though its price and popularity are increasing, it is still susceptible to big swings in value because in truth Bitcoin is still in its infancy, so congratulations, you are early to the party.\r\n\r\nBut as more and more people own (and use) it, there’s every reason to believe that cryptocurrency will become more stable over time, and prove to be the ultimate form of sound money.', 1),
(10, 'Step 1: Crypto Basics', 'Bitcoin, scarcity & trust in money', 'The importance of money holding value', 'Money is a metre/yardstick for measuring value. This aspect of money is taken for granted by everyone who participates in the economy by using it as a medium of exchange. All trade and economic activity relies on it - it’s like a universal language. And just like when we speak our own language, we don’t often stop and consider it; we just take it for granted.\r\n\r\nCan you imagine a world where a metre kept constantly changing? Science, engineering and almost all commerce would be impossible.\r\n\r\nThe same goes for economic activity in a world where the value of money doesn’t hold. Even just buying a coffee would require both a lot of maths and a huge amount of risk, let alone more complex stuff like mortgages or insurance. The complexities of modern commerce would be impossible and we\'d revert back to the simple credit system mentioned in the first article. \r\n\r\nUnlike the metre, however, which is a fixed, objective and universally agreed measurement that will never change, money’s value - its measurement - is subjective and therefore changes.\r\n\r\nThat change is the result of money’s relative scarcity; the impact on money’s value of the increase in its supply is called inflation.\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/100trillionUSD/status/1376118841965678594?s=09\r\n\r\nThat’s exactly what happens in countries suffering from inflation, and why sound money is so important and shouldn’t be taken for granted. Extreme instability of money is hard to imagine, but Germany between the wars gives good illustrations.\r\n\r\n- The cost of a meal could change between ordering it and receiving the bill.\r\n- People needed suitcases or wheelbarrows to collect their salary\r\n- In October 1923 the number of German marks to the English pound were equivalent to the number of yards to the sun.\r\n\r\nBefore the First World War (1913) the German Mark, British Shilling, French Franc and Italian Lira were all worth about the same. At the end of 1923 this was the exchange rate for the Mark.\r\n\r\nIf Germany of the 1920’s seems distant, similar - if slightly less extreme - examples have played out in Venezuela, Zimbabwe and Argentina, while lower, but consistent, rates of inflation erode the spending power of every fiat currency.\r\n\r\nSo if the key to money holding value is scarcity, how does cryptocurrency achieve digital scarcity?', 2),
(11, 'Step 1: Crypto Basics', 'Bitcoin, scarcity & trust in money', 'Achieving digital scarcity', 'A scarce commodity is something that has a limited supply; it isn’t easy to create, copy, or otherwise access.\r\n\r\nPhysical stuff can be scarce (like we’ve seen with gold), but digital things are an entirely different matter. A byte is very easy and cheap to copy, as the music and film industries have painfully discovered in the early days of the internet. \r\n\r\nThat’s why digital money, such as cryptocurrency, isn’t a file you keep on your hard drive; that would be impractical as anyone with a computer would then be able to just infinitely copy it around.\r\n\r\nInstead, all forms of digital currency - both fiat and crypto -  rely on an accounting system based on digital ledgers. A ledger being an organised record of debits and credits against account holders, providing a running balance.\r\n\r\nYou may be surprised to hear that 97% of all fiat money only exists digitally. So all the money in your bank account, for example, are just entries on your bank’s accounting system. Even the 3% physical banknotes and coins are accounted for as entries on a central bank’s digital books. \r\n\r\nBitcoin is also based on a digital ledger. The crucial difference between Bitcoin and Fiat is the way rules are created to govern if/when/how much new money is added to the system and how the ledger is maintained.\r\n\r\nAnd it just so happens that these differences change everything. ', 2),
(12, 'Step 1: Crypto Basics', 'Bitcoin, scarcity & trust in money', 'The problem of trust in digital money', 'Money can only be useful (and sound) if the ledgers can be trusted to be accurate and honest, and if its supply is kept under control. This means unreasonable amounts of money won’t suddenly be created or destroyed, with consequential impact on its spending power.\r\n\r\nSo how do fiat currencies solve this today? Simple: the government manages money the ledger for its currency either directly, by controlling .physical money creation (minting) and managing and allowing the creation of credit/debit relationships between itself, banks and people. \r\n\r\nTo do this the central bank licences a few select institutions (like banks and building societies) to keep ledgers of their own. The sum of the credit of all the records from the ledgers of all the banks of a country (including the central bank) is the total supply of that currency.\r\n\r\nWe then collectively agree that the only books which are to be trusted are those kept by these institutions, and that they will keep the books properly. This consensus comes from trust that they’ll keep their obligations, as well as in the rule of law.\r\n\r\nThis authority-based trust system is what holds the traditional money systems together. The reason we can use our money online is because we trust that banks won’t let people cheat and spend more money than they have. \r\n\r\nWe even trust them to ‘create’ money, lending out more than the deposits they hold, and assuming risks for complex investment strategies (more on this below).\r\n\r\nThough the system in practice is far more complicated, the general principle relies on trust. We must trust that institutions will behave in everyone’s best interest, and by doing so we grant them the authority and control over the money system.\r\n\r\nEven if this centralised system works most of the time, it still has a few noticeable weaknesses. For example, while your money is legally yours, it’s never really under your custody. \r\n\r\nEvery time you pay for a €2 coffee with your card, you are effectively asking your bank to subtract €2 from your account, and for the vendor’s bank to add €2 to the shop’s account. \r\n\r\nA single central point of failure is more vulnerable to corruption, manipulation, or plain old external pressure. This leaves the door open to abuse, mismanagement, and economic exclusion (e.g. “the unbanked” - we’ll talk about this in another lesson).\r\n\r\nHowever, sticking to our central theme, the most worrying side effect of fiat money - money based only on institutional trust - is how it undermines scarcity. ', 2),
(13, 'Step 1: Crypto Basics', 'Bitcoin, scarcity & trust in money', 'A growing money supply', 'As more value is created via economic activity, new money must be introduced in the system so that the economy can continue to flow. \r\n\r\nGrossly oversimplifying, new fiat money is created by Commercial Banks. The extent to which they create new money is rationed by the Central Bank. These are common ways: \r\n\r\n1. Providing credit, like loans to a new customer that become deposits. \r\n2.Buying existing assets which again become deposits\r\n3. Providing overdraft facilities, which are deposits that can be spent. \r\n\r\nThis rationing is a delicate balance. On the one hand, if too little money is created, spending slows down and the economy may grind to a halt. In practice, this almost never happens. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if too much money is created, then the value of the entire supply is diluted, prices rise, and everyone loses purchasing power. This is called inflation, and in extreme cases turns to hyperinflation, which may lead to a whole country going bankrupt. Historically, this tends to happen rather often with national currencies.\r\n\r\nEither way, human institutions are ultimately in charge of the levers to the money supply, meaning there’s no real scarcity. This is why fiat currencies, by definition, can’t be considered sound money.\r\n\r\nAs we’ve just seen, centralised systems can be vulnerable.

The wallet is programmed to pay out Satoshis at predetermined intervals, and there may be a minimum withdrawal threshold set. \r\n\r\nFor instance, you may be entitled to claim coins from a particular faucet once every 24 hours, and able to withdraw your coins once you have accumulated 1,000 satoshis (0.00001 BTC).\r\n\r\nMost faucets require you to register using an email address and password, before compelling you to complete tasks that will entitle you to free coins. These tasks can include watching videos, clicking on ads, completing quizzes, rolling dice, and solving puzzles.\r\n\r\nSome of these tasks may sound fun, but they can quickly become repetitive, particularly in an environment where you are bombarded with banner ads and other promotions.\r\n\r\nEach bitcoin faucet will limit the amount you can claim per account and often by IP address too, to prevent people from creating duplicate accounts.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is nothing to stop you from signing up for different faucets, and working your way around them, claiming coins from each site as you go. While laborious, this can provide a system for accruing a very modest amount of cryptocurrency. Some people go further and use bots.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, bitcoin isn’t the only cryptocurrency that can be claimed in this manner: there are faucets for many of the most popular cryptocurrencies on the market. Given its value, and its history of outperforming most other cryptocurrencies, however, you may reason that bitcoin is the best faucet to choose.\r\n\r\nA good bitcoin faucet, relative to other faucets, will have a high number of users (since this suggests that the site is trustworthy) and offer payouts that are above the market average. It will also have low withdrawal fees and ideally allow you to withdraw your BTC at any time.', 7),
(48, 'Step 2: How to earn crypto', 'Faucets & the free crypto myth', 'Free crypto comes at a price', 'Even if the sums that can be earned from bitcoin faucets today are miniscule, you might reason that they’re worth using anyway. After all, just like with Andresen’s faucet in 2010, holding onto the Satoshis you receive could prove a highly profitable play a few years from now. That’s why ‘stacking sats’ is a very popular, and sensible, bitcoin philosophy.\r\n\r\nWhile it’s true that bitcoin could be worth significantly more in the future than it is today, the greatest exponential growth occurred in bitcoin’s early years when it was still being discovered. Thus, a few dollars’ worth of bitcoin earned from faucets today probably isn’t going to make you rich, no matter how long you hodl, but 4x in a year does suggest that there is some upside.\r\n\r\nAs a reality check, look at this faucet payout schedule in USD from early 2020\r\n\r\n- Min withdrawal: 2.48 USD\r\n- Min transaction fees: 0.066USD\r\n- 0.0017 USD dispensed per hour so 1 USD = 588 hours\r\n- A faucet user would have to spend 73 working days accumulating BTC to meet cash out thresholds\r\n\r\nClearly that is a lot of effort for such a small reward, though you do have to factor the increase in BTC price of 400% in 2020.\r\n\r\nIf you are clear about the effort/reward dynamic, it shouldn’t deter you from experimenting with faucets; they’re a useful way to acquire BTC for free and familiarise yourself with how a bitcoin wallet works, given they are built into your faucet account. \r\n\r\nFaucets are also gamified, so there is a fun element and combined with some of other suggestions in our Earn Crypto section, can add up to a modest sum which you might then apply other tactics to grow further, such as trading or gambling.\r\n\r\nThat being said, those “free” coins you earn every time you interact with a faucet come with a price, namely your time, attention, and data.\r\n\r\nFaucet operators aren’t giving away bitcoin out of the goodness of their hearts; they’re doing for commercial purposes. Typically because they earn money from advertisers for forcing you to watch commercials or submit your personal data, which is used for marketing purposes. \r\n\r\nIn some cases users are encourage to try and gamble with their free bitcoin on casino games, to win their way to a sum that can be withdrawn. Given the bitcoin came for free you may not see any issue with this, but the idea is to habituate the playing on games such that you end depositing your own bitcoin. The faucet funds are the proxy for free spins at a regular online casino.\r\n\r\nYou may conclude that this doesn’t sit well with Bitcoin and everything it stands for: financial freedom and the ability to transact in relative privacy.\r\n\r\nMost sites that offer free bitcoin via faucets do not disclose how your data is used or who it’s shared with. After weighing the evidence, you might find that faucets simply aren’t worth the trade-offs they carry, or mitigate this by using an email especially for this purpose.\r\n\r\nNot all faucets work the same, however, and you may find some that provide a fairer deal in terms of what they demand of you and reward you. Assess each site on its own merits, and decide whether the faucet in question is worth your time and precious data.\r\n\r\nBenefits to using bitcoin faucets:\r\n* Can claim free BTC on a regular basis.\r\n* No requirement to already own cryptocurrency.\r\n* Little technical knowledge required.\r\n* Multiple faucets can be used to maximise earnings.\r\n\r\nDrawbacks to using bitcoin faucets:\r\n\r\n* Only dispense small quantities of BTC at a time (usually a few cents’ worth).\r\n* Many faucets have a minimum withdrawal threshold, meaning you can’t claim your coins until you’ve earned enough from the faucet.\r\n* Require sharing your data with third parties.\r\n\r\nIf you like the idea of earning free cryptocurrency, but aren’t convinced by the concept of faucets, there are plenty of other ways to acquire crypto for free, as you’ll discover in our next guide.', 7),

Unlike many of the bitcoin faucet sites on the web, Coinbase’s platform doesn’t feel spammy, and the information you will acquire through completing its educational primers is very useful.\r\n\r\nNot only this, but because of Coinbase\'s influence, when it lists new coins it tends to have a very significant impact on their price, as a huge new audience are exposed to them, bringing volume. This has been estimated at an average of 91% increase in the price of newly listed coins over five days, according to Messari.\r\n\r\nThe relevance here is that Coinbase Earn and Learn campaigns go live in tandem with the coins being listed for trading.', 8),

They are often called Refer-a-friend schemes for this reason.\r\n\r\nThe reward can be a fixed payment per user recruited (in crypto or fiat), ongoing commission based on how much customers trade or sometimes discounted use of the service.\r\n\r\nReferral schemes are very simple to use, with new customers automatically provided with a referral link or code that they simply share with their friends, along with a persuasive description of the service.. \r\n\r\nAny new customers who create an account using the specific link or code, will trigger a payment to the customer who referred them, so long as they fulfil certain activity criteria. \r\n\r\nThis last part is especially important to pay attention to; you are only going to get rewarded for customers who are actively using the service.\r\n\r\nHere’s an example from Coinbase:\r\n\r\nThe referral code you share looks like this: https://www.coinbase.com/join/YOUR_REFERRAL_ID\r\n\r\nThe criteria:\r\n\r\n    If your friend visits coinbase.com/trade and initiates a buy or sell of $100 USD or more (or 100 USD equivalent of your domestic currency) within 180 days of opening his or her account, you both will receive a 10 USD (or 10 USD equivalent of your domestic currency) referral bonus when the order completes. Orders can take up to 4 business days to complete.\r\n\r\nThe Coinbase referral scheme places no limit on the number of customers you can get paid to refer, so your potential to earn simply depends on the effort you are prepared to put in.\r\n\r\nThough the reward is in USD or equivalent, you can simply exchange this for crypto in order to build your stack.', 9),

Many people use forums like Reddit where a popular post can boost your exposure, especially if it gets indexed by Google.\r\n\r\nA word of warning though: blasting referral links all over your social media may seem “spammy.” Only share ref links for crypto projects that have a positive reputation, or of new projects that look to be building something valuable. \r\n\r\nRemember, your reputation is also at stake when you’re encouraging your followers to sign up for a service, so only recommend platforms you can vouch for. If those you refer have a bad experience, they may hold you responsible.\r\n\r\nIf you are considering just creating duplicate accounts and referring yourself, most referral schemes will have means for monitoring that kind of abuse.', 9),
(55, 'Step 2: How to earn crypto', 'Earning by promoting crypto', 'Earn crypto from affiliate schemes', 'Many crypto companies, including exchanges, wallets, and blockchains, offer both referral and affiliate schemes. They use the same mechanisms - custom sign up links - but rather than being existing customers, Affiliates are independent of the service they are promoting, and generally have a dedicated website or social media; in some cases they are multi-million euro businesses in their own right.\r\n\r\nTo be an Affiliate you generally go through a separate registration process, specific to the scheme, accepting terms and conditions related to how the affiliate program works, and get access to an Affiliate system showing your referral activity. \r\n\r\nThis also gives you access to specific marketing materials like banners or landing pages, to help with the job of marketing.\r\n\r\nBeing an Affiliate is a step-up from simply referring friends and family, requiring a greater level of commitment, but the rewards are much greater.\r\n\r\nAffiliates schemes tend to pay commission rather than fixed fees, and are more open to paying in crypto, so if you are able to attract a very active customer the potential rewards are enormous.\r\n\r\nBy working as an affiliate, you can earn revenue in cryptocurrency, or denominated in a stablecoin such as USDT. Stablecoins are tokens that represent fiat currency on a 1:1 basis. For example, 1 USDT is worth US$1.\r\n\r\nProfessional crypto traders with a large Twitter following can earn thousands of dollars from referral links, which offer new users a discount on trading fees, and pay a reward to the affiliate.', 9),

Often, these tasks are assigned to the project’s community in the form of a bounty. Anyone who completes the assignment will be eligible for the reward on offer.\r\n\r\nThis might take the form of a meme competition, in which community members who create the funniest or most original meme will receive a bounty. There are also more advanced bounties issued, however, that reward users who possess particular skills.\r\n\r\nA project might issue a bounty for anyone who can create a three-minute explainer video about their technology and share it on YouTube. Or they might allocate a bounty to anyone who can design their new logo or sign up for their new application. \r\n\r\nIf you have particular digital skills, including coding, web design, copywriting, and graphic design, bounty programs can prove a useful way to earn crypto. Coindesk was reporting on the growth of Bounty Campaigns back in 2018.\r\n\r\nWhen a video game developer launches a new release – say, GTA5 by Rockstar – there is a huge amount of work to be done in bug testing. Gamers who are hired for the task can earn bounties for exploring the world in detail and noting down any errors they encounter. \r\n\r\nWell, it’s the same with crypto: new projects need users to test out their services, provide feedback on ways it can be improved, and report any bugs they encounter.\r\n\r\nWhile some of this work requires experience of coding, there are tasks that are suited to end users with no programming experience. Just for downloading a crypto app, testing it out and reporting bugs, you could earn a bounty. \r\n\r\nThis is an effective way of expanding your crypto knowledge and gaining a deeper understanding of how different crypto components work while being rewarded for your time.\r\n\r\nThe biggest crypto communities tend to run the most organised Bounty Campaigns. The original bitcoin forum - www.bitcointalk.org - has full-time Bounty Managers running schemes and recruiting users.on behalf of crypto services. Here’s a recent list of active Bounty campaigns. \r\n\r\nYou’ll need a Bitcointalk account and crypto wallet to participate in a Bounty Campaign.

Other similar forums such as www.cryptotalk.org run similar schemes\r\n\r\nYou can also find Bounty Programs by following popular crypto projects and crypto personalities on Twitter, as well as checking out crypto channels on Discord and Telegram.

Your challenge is to figure out how to tap into that potential, manage the risk and make money, by learning how to trade cryptocurrency.\r\n\r\nTo keep things simple at this point, let’s assume that what we mean by making money from cryptocurrency is selling it for more than you bought it for (later in this section we’ll explain that it is potentially much more complex than that) and use Bitcoin as an example.  \r\n\r\nWith this in mind, and thinking about the two broad approaches to profiting from cryptocurrency we’ve introduced, think about these two questions:. \r\n\r\n1. Will bitcoin’s price go up or down over the next 24hrs?\r\n2. Will bitcoin’s price go up or down over the next 4 years?\r\n\r\nBoth questions require you to risk your money predicting bitcoin’s future price movement, which is uncertain. The crucial difference is the time frame, as this makes you think about that uncertainty, the risk to your investment, differently. \r\n\r\nThe reason for this is because what influences bitcoin’s price over 24hrs, is different to what influences its trajectory over four years.\r\n\r\nYes, the 24hr chart is a subset of the four year chart, and in aggregate daily changes will smooth out to form long term patterns, but you cannot make a long term forecast based on what happens on a given day, and visa-versa. \r\n\r\nThe factors that influence long term change are different to those that influence short term change. \r\n\r\nWhen we talk about buying and selling over short periods of time we are talking about Trading. Making frequent bets on short-term price movement.\r\n\r\nIn contrast buying and then passively holding for an extended period of time to then sell for a profit is considered Investing.\r\n\r\nThe world of Bitcoin has even come up with a term that describes the determination to hold the asset over the long term - Hodling.\r\n\r\nSo if your interest is in making money from cryptocurrency you need to understand the distinction and the different decision-making processes associated with each. \r\n\r\nYou don’t have to choose, you can be both a Trader and Investor, or neither, so long as you appreciate the difference and separate your activities..', 11),

You might flinch at use of the word ‘betting’ but trading is a form of gambling. \r\n\r\nThe trick is reducing it to a skill-based decision - through a structured approach - and tilting the odds/risk in your favour. \r\n\r\nIf you simply open an account with an exchange and place trades based on nothing but instinct, or a random tweet you read, it becomes a luck-based process. \r\n\r\nYou may as well be flipping a coin, except that the odds will be against you (as will be explained) and you will almost certainly get burned.\r\n\r\nYou can think of learning to trade like learning to play poker. You face a steep learning curve with the likelihood that the experienced players will take advantage of the novices. \r\n\r\nThis is known as the Pareto Principle - the majority of profit will be generated by a minority of participants. The learning curve gets steeper in relation to the potential returns. \r\n\r\nYou need to have your eyes open and feet on the ground to stand any chance of being successful, especially if you want to trade rather than invest. The majority of traders blow up in their first year, and that isn’t just because they fail to understand the basics of how to trade cryptocurrency and the Pareto Principle, it is because they fail to understand themselves.\r\n\r\nTrading requires knowledge and mathematical discipline - crunching numbers and trying to find an edge against the market - but just as important is having clear objectives and psychological discipline. \r\n\r\nYou cannot expect to buy at the exact bottom and sell at the top. This tweet summarises how fleeting the highs of the Bitcoin market have been.\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/Pladizow/status/1380508184901775360?s=09\r\n\r\nInstead you need to set realistic expectations, and if you start active trading, record your actions in something called a Trading Journal.\r\n\r\nPsychological discipline starts with being honest with yourself about what you are trying to achieve and how - a Trading Journal plays a key part in that. As a complete novice, the likelihood that you’ll become rich overnight is tiny, the equivalent to winning the lottery. So start with realistic expectations. \r\n\r\nIf you were learning to drive a car would you just follow a few online tutorials then hit the motorway? Trading, like learning to drive a car, is a risky activity that requires the right kind of preparation.\r\n\r\nA successful trader will be happy simply making a return above what they could derive from their capital otherwise - the opportunity cost also known as discount rate. \r\n\r\nThey are not looking to knock it out of the park with every trade, and many of their trades will end with a loss. You need to be able to understand and accept that.\r\n\r\nIf you feel uncomfortable making losing trades and overcome by a desire to try and immediately regain losses, you aren’t cut out for trading (or any other form of gambling).\r\n\r\nIt is equally important to separate luck from skill. Being on the right side of a trade doesn’t mean you’ve cracked it, unless you can satisfy yourself that you weren’t just lucky. It is very easy to post-rationalise a trade and attribute success to your approach rather than simply being lucky. \r\n\r\nIf you put enough monkeys in front of a typewriter one of them will eventually produce the Bitcoin Whitepaper. This doesn’t make them Satoshi Nakamoto. It\'s called Survivorship Bias and the same applies to trading. It is one of a host of behavioural biases that impact effective decision making and can lead to failure.\r\n\r\nAs we’ll see later in the section, there are different types of Trader, the key differentiator is the amount of time you are able to dedicate to doing proper research.

Every market participant will in theory be utilising all available information about bitcoin - Technical, and Fundamental - as well considering the behaviour of other market participants to discover the true price. \r\n\r\nWe’ll unpack the influences on price discovery later in the section, but at this point our attention is just on introducing the idea that price is discovered by market participants and trading facilitated by exchanges.\r\n\r\nExchanges match buyers and sellers - looking to express their opinion about price via trades - continuously 24/7/365, generating bitcoin’s price - and this is where price comes from; an agreement on perceived value at a specific point in time.. \r\n\r\nEach exchange platform functions independently, matching the supply (sellers) and demand (buyers) of its own customers,; there is no single source of price truth for bitcoin outside of exchanges. \r\n\r\nPrice aggregators, such as Coinmarketcap, pull in prices from the largest exchanges and use a weighted average - taking into consideration the volume of transactions - to produce a broad price value . \r\n\r\nYou\'ll see from the image below that there is price differential among the top ten exchanges contributing trading volume for bitcoin. That difference is greater where the Trading Pair is different.\r\n\r\nThe aggregated exchange data from Coinmarketcap can be considered reliable enough to represent a price benchmark for bitcoin but as the ability to buy bitcoin varies around the world, price discovery can be distorted.', 12),

If not, users would simply buy at the lowest price on exchange A and sell at the highest available price on exchange B (aka arbitrage). \r\n\r\nCompared to more mature assets - like gold or fiat currencies - bitcoin has a long way to grow, but given billions are traded everyday, its price is becoming more efficient, meaning it rarely trades at a high premium across exchanges. Arbitrage does happen, but is only effective at scale - by professional traders - and not relevant for someone just learning about how to trade cryptocurrency.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, an important exception to bitcoin\'s price discovery and the potential for significant variation across exchanges.. \r\n\r\nWhere an exchange exists within different market conditions, such as countries with weak fiat currencies and heavy controls on the exchange/movement of that currency - such as Venezuela, Argentina, Nigeria and Turkey - you’ll actually see the price of bitcoin being much higher as demand is higher. \r\n\r\nThis recent article from Coindesk illustrates the point, with bitcoin trading at a premium in Nigeria given the weakness of the Naira and the attempts to legislate against its use. The premium however, isn’t on bitcoin’s price, rather the informal conversion (black market price) of the Naira to the Dollar.\r\n\r\nThe controls placed on buying/selling in those specific markets obstruct the natural process of price discovery, because the demand from people in Turkey can only be met locally. Arbitrage is difficult because of the logistics of getting access to buy/sell across these markets.', 12),

Exchanges aren’t however, the only way to buy bitcoin.\r\n\r\nWhere an individual or organisation wants to buy or sell a large amount of bitcoin, they may not want to go through an exchange because there are unlikely to be enough buyers or sellers at the price they want to execute at. And given exchanges expose trading intent (as we\'ll see below) the simple act of placing an order on an exchange can move price. \r\n\r\nThis type of transaction is described as OTC - Over the Counter - happening outside of the regular exchange market mechanism. Trades are negotiated through a broker, and involve very large sums.

Significant Bids at a specific price suggest support levels or conversely Asks might indicate a point at which price may struggle to surpass.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that the Order Book represents Limit Orders, which are trades requested at specific prices for specific amounts.

Volatility=risk. \r\n\r\nLooking at price movement with the aid of candles is the first step toward technical analysis, as they provide a first layer of detail of price signal and pattern. \r\n\r\nA successful trading strategy will interpret recognisable signals and patterns as being indicative of specific future price movement.\r\n\r\nThe next signal we’ll look at in the following article is trading volume.', 14),
(85, 'Step 3: How to trade crypto', 'Understanding crypto trading volume', 'Total Volume & Market Efficiency', 'The total volume traded for a given cryptocurrency has a direct relationship with how volatile it is. Remember, price represents the balance of opinions between buyers and sellers. \r\n\r\nIf an equal amount (in terms of volume) is being bought and sold then price will be stable, but stability suggests that people’s opinion about the price are well informed; this is known as market efficiency.\r\n\r\nMature markets with significant volume and good price discovery have less volatility. Cryptocurrency is inherently volatile because it is immature and its adoption path is uncertain. Market participants are an unusual mix of recreational investors (hodlers), miners, speculators and institutional investors each with varying opinions and motivations, with those opinions subject to significant outside influences. \r\n\r\nSo when looking at trading a given cryptocurrency, the total volume traded will immediately tell you how volatile it is likely to be. The change in volume over time will also give you a sense of interest in the project.\r\n\r\nIt may seem a bit obvious but in order to trade a particular cryptocurrency it has to be listed on an exchange. Exchanges choose which coins to trade, and being listed on the bigger exchanges can make a huge difference to volume.\r\n\r\nIf, for example, you have an opinion about an obscure cryptocurrency and want to buy it at a specific price. The absence of volume is going to make that really hard - there won’t  be enough buyers and sellers, so the difference between the available Offers (buyers) and Bids (sellers) - known as the Spread - will be wide.\r\n\r\nThe wider the spread, the less efficient a market and therefore the more volatile. Websites like Coinmarketcap provide historical volume data.\r\n\r\nThe daily volume for Shopping is so low that any significant new volume of trading will have a big impact on the market. The volume indicated is spread across a number of exchanges, each of which will have inefficient markets for anyone wanted to buy and sell the Shopping coin.\r\n\r\nCoinmarketcap provides a Liquidity Score for each cryptocurrency on the exchanges where it is traded, essentially a measure of how deep the Order Book is, and the likelihood that Buying or Selling will adversely affect the price, what is known as Slippage.', 15),

The higher the bar, the greater the volume; green bars are associated with a positive price move within the Candle, while red bars indicate a falling price associated with the volume.', 15),
(87, 'Step 3: How to trade crypto', 'Understanding crypto trading volume', 'Common Volume Indicators ', '1. Momentum\r\n\r\nIncreasing volume of buying will push the price of a cryptocurrency higher, but for that to continue, volume must be maintained. In that way, volume can be a good indicator of price momentum.\r\n\r\nRising prices on declining volume can indicate declining momentum and potential reversal. Falling prices on declining volume can equally signal a shift in direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Spikes & Exhaustion\r\n\r\nThough spikes in volume can be associated with new momentum in either direction, they can also signal the tail end of a move, in what is known as Exhaustion. A large spike in volume might indicate that laggards are buying into a move as it peaks, exhausting the buyers or sellers, and signalling the end of the move.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. On Balance Volume\r\n\r\nOn Balance Volume is a simple measure of the influence of changes in volume that can be correlated with price. To calculate OBV start with an arbitrary number say 100, and if daily volume increases add the volume to OBV; if it decreases, subtract it. \r\n\r\n\r\n4. Money Flow Index (MFI)\r\n\r\nMoney Flow Index runs from 0-100 and uses volume as an indicator of overbought or oversold conditions. Much like Relative Strength Index it is a measure of whether the market is getting overheated.\r\n\r\nMFI values above 80 are suggestive of a price reversal due to excessive buying volume, whereas a value of 20 or lower may suggest the opposite - excessive selling volume and oversold conditions.\r\n\r\nThese examples are just a few of the possible indicators commonly used in Technical Analysis, and illustrate one of the biggest difficulties facing a Trader. What tools choose from among the multitude of potential indicators? \r\n\r\nGiven you are just starting out, it is wise to keep it simple and use volume as part of a general assessment of liquidity (and potential slippage) and as an aid to momentum.\r\n\r\nOur next article on how to trade crypto will introduce some of the most commonly used technical indicators which can be used alongside the skills acquired so far in terms of understanding price discovery, price charts, candlesticks and volume.', 15),
(88, 'Step 3: How to trade crypto', 'What is Technical Analysis?', 'Measuring Volatility', 'Returning to bitcoin as our example, the amount by which its price goes up and down is measured by Volatility. Volatility is what determines the level of risk you take on in trying to make a successful trade. \r\n\r\nIf you look at a daily bitcoin chart by eye, you’ll see peaks and troughs that look a bit like a seismograph, which is a useful analogy. Each movement is a reaction to the intensity of buyers and sellers, in the way a seismograph illustrates the intensity of tectonic activity. \r\n\r\nThe literal definition of price volatility is the standard deviation of daily % changes. In simple terms, how much does the price deviate each day from the average.\r\n\r\nThough it is important to understand how to calculate Bitcoin Volatility, measures are freely available online, here’s one example for 2020. The majority of the year the Volatility Index was somewhere between 2 and 4%, but with a huge spike in March/April, as it hit over 10%.\r\n\r\nReturning to our earthquake analogy, this is like a 9 on the Richter scale, a major event. This was the reaction to the impact of Covid19 on the broader financial markets.\r\n\r\nA Volatility Index of over 10% literally means theoretical returns of that size for daily trades within that period. For comparison, the volatility of gold averages around 1.2%, while other major currencies average between 0.5% and 1.0%.\r\n\r\nThe Volatility can be even greater when looking at an even shorter time frame, as it is simply an average, which means that on certain days the risks of trading are very high. \r\n\r\nThe seismic event of Covid19 is virtually impossible to predict, but these kinds of market shocks must be expected. If you decide to trade regularly then there will be days when you are likely to experience significant swings in both directions.\r\n\r\nAs volatility works by looking at the variance in average bitcoin price, charts enable you to automatically plot what are known as moving averages, for standard periods, and overlay the spot price. \r\n\r\nMoving averages are one of the first indicators available within the technical analysis toolkit. They essentially allow you to view today’s price in a wider context. The longer moving average timeframe the more valuable the conclusion.', 16),

A price chart will plot the moving average alongside the actual price movement.\r\n\r\nMoving averages start at short intervals such as five or seven days, then are calculated at longer intervals up to 200 days. Moving Averages for shorter time periods tend to be used for technical analysis, while the longer MAs are popular for fundamental analysis.\r\n\r\nMoving averages are useful as indicators of resistance levels, essentially indicating likely floors or ceilings to price given the aggregate view they give of price over the longer term.\r\n\r\nThe slope of a Moving Average can be a useful guide to market direction, as it steepens it suggests that there is momentum in price, whereas a flattening MA might indicate upcoming bearish conditions.\r\n\r\nThe price chart below is from March 16th, 2021 plotting three moving averages against price. over a seven day period.\r\n\r\n* Price is blue\r\n* 7 Day Moving Average is yellow\r\n* 20 Day Moving Average is orange\r\n* 100 Day Moving Average is red\r\n\r\nYou can see from the chart that price and the short term Moving Averages are closely in sync, but for the longer term 100 day MA trends below them, suggesting that price was due the correction which happened on March 15th, bringing all these indicators into convergence.\r\n\r\nSome of the strongest Moving Average indicators are where they cross:\r\n\r\n- A shorter Moving Average falling below a longer one is bearish\r\n- A shorter Moving Average rising above a longer one is bullish\r\n- The Death Cross is where the 50 day MA falls below the 200\r\n\r\nAn often quoted stat for Bitcoin for example, is that Bitcoin’s Monthly close has never been below the 200 week Moving Average - so an average which was first calculated when Bitcoin was 200 weeks old. \r\n\r\nThe 200 WMA seems to increase like clockwork, and given the length of time it is calculated over, smooths all the volatility in that period and points to Bitcoin’s successful function as a store of value. \r\n\r\nMoving Averages are a useful tool when used in conjunction with Cost Averaging, as they provide a way to trim or increase regular purchases based on the slope of 200 day Moving Average.\r\n\r\nAs with all Technical Indicators, there are levels of complexity to Moving Averages. Experienced traders tend to using more sophisticated variants such as Exponential Moving Averages (giving more weight to more recent data) or Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) which measures the relationship between two moving averages.\r\n\r\nAnother popular technical tool that serves a similar purpose to Moving Averages is the Relative Strength Index.

An RSI value above 70 tends to suggest overbought conditions, while a value below 30 that a cryptocurrency is undervalued from excessive selling.\r\n\r\nThe RSI calculation is quite simple, essentially looking at days when the price gains in relation to those where price falls. It is calculated with this formula:\r\n\r\n    RSI = 100 – 100 / (1 + RS)\r\n\r\nRS is the average increase in price over 14 unit periods / average decrease in price over the same period. A unit could be a day or hour.\r\n\r\nIn this way RSI is a measure of momentum in the market but if it was as simple as waiting for the RSI to hit 70 or 30 and sell or buy accordingly we would all be very wealthy.\r\n\r\nBelow is an example RSI seven day chart for BTC/USD on March 16th, 2021.\r\n\r\n- Notice the way that the linear price is in the top pane\r\n- RSI appears in a pane below with the key thresholds of 70 & 30 plotted\r\n- RSI correlates relatively closely to price and its highest point of 74 on March 14th acts as leading indicator for the subsequent drop in price.\r\n\r\nMarkets can support overbought and oversold conditions depending on other contributing factors so RSI shouldn’t be relied on in isolation. It is what is known as a Leading Indicator, an indicator of where price might be about to go.\r\n\r\nMoving Averages are an example of a Lagging Indicator, an indication of historic pattern or confirmation of a trend. \r\n\r\nThe next article in this section on how to trade cryptocurrency will look at leading and lagging indicators in more depth, including information specific to the functioning of cryptocurrencies and the wider ecosystem that provide useful information to inform trading.', 16),

The middle line is just a Simple Moving Average (we discussed Moving Averages previously) usually at 20 days/weeks. The top and bottom lines are two standard deviations above and below the Moving Average.\r\n\r\nSo Bollinger Bands essentially plot the extremes of potential volatility. When the bands are close together, markets are stable, the trick is to know the signs that volatility is coming, and obviously in which direction.\r\n\r\nAs volatility increases,  the bands will expand as the potential range of change increases. Conversely, when Bollinger Bands are far apart, it\'s important to try and pre-empt them squeezing back closer together as volatility declines.\r\n\r\nBecause of their use of a Moving Average and standard deviation, Bollinger Bands are often described as mean reversion indicators.', 17),

Coupons therefore go up as maturity increases because there is greater uncertainty about inflation going forward.\r\n\r\nIncreasing Bond Yields are therefore a leading indicator of inflation, and Bitcoin should fair well in an inflationary environment because of its store of value characteristics.

Hype can sustain interest during a bull market, but as with the dotcom bubble, businesses that lack a clear use case will eventually fail.\r\n\r\nWe saw this during the ICO boom of 2017/18 when projects generated astronomical investment and unrealistic expectations of future value on basis of flimsy concepts, often no more than ideas.\r\n\r\nDragon Coin is a good example. It raised $320million from an ICO and traded at an all-time-high of $2.40 in March 2018, but three years later, with its development abandoned, price is down 99.74%. The  most obvious reason being it had no clear purpose.\r\n\r\nIts website is poorly put together, which would be an immediate red flag, and it describes itself as the \'Entertainment Token\' but text attempting to explain what that means reads like word soup. \r\n\r\nAny crypto project should be able to articulate the problem being solved in a single sentence and you’d expect to find it prominently on the project website and on page 1 of something called a Whitepaper.\r\n\r\nHere’s what the first paragraph of Bitcoin’s whitepaper says:\r\n\r\nThis very succinctly explains what Bitcoin is and the problem it is solving.

The price has since risen 200% beyond that high, yet general search sentiment is yet to reach that level.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion: recent price increases are not being driven as much by recreational investors as in 2017, but more by institutional money.

This is money that might be invested or saved. \r\n\r\nThere is no specific rule for how to allocate your discretionary income though there is agreement that it should be spread across a spectrum of assets by risk.\r\n\r\nThe largest proportion should be for the least risky - savings and indexed share funds - and the smallest proportion for the most risky. \r\n\r\nGiven that cryptocurrency is inherently risky, you should only consider allocating a small proportion, perhaps 5% or less, of your discretionary income.\r\n\r\nThere are many people who feel very strongly about crypto and you may see Tweets or Instagram updates talking about going ‘all in’. It would be extremely inadvisable to allocate 100% of discretionary income.\r\n\r\nDepending on how much your discretionary income amounts to, you can decide what approach, if any to take, but bear in mind that there are fees associated with depositing funds with exchanges. Trading small amounts might also lead you toward trading obscure and risky cryptocurrencies, seeking huge returns.', 19),

Making money isn’t a specific enough answer.\r\n\r\nTo start with there are other things you can do with your money to derive a return, so what you intend to make from trading cryptocurrency needs to justify the comparative risk. \r\n\r\nThis will start with the options of leaving your money in a Fiat savings account or some basic index tracker fund but the premise of Learn Crypto is that cryptocurrency represents sounder money than fiat. So, once you’ve done research and accept that premise, you should be comparing against non-fiat opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis can include things like precious metals, collectibles, property and art. Bear in mind that the returns from these options might not seem as sexy as crypto, but that is because the risk involved is far less.\r\n\r\nIf you are satisfied that crypto represents the best risk-adjusted investment for a portion of your discretionary income, the section on earning cryptocurrency walks through the risk spectrum. \r\n\r\nYou’ll see that passive interest can generate 5% return for Bitcoin, higher for other coins, which is a good benchmark to start from - though this includes counterparty risk - which is why we include it below in potential strategies.\r\n\r\nMaking a reasoned assessment of the return you intend to generate also serves the important purpose of quantifying your ambition. As you navigate the crypto world you’ll see a lot references of ‘to the Moon’ or ‘Diamond Hands’ suggesting that hodlers see crypto as something they aren’t considering selling.\r\n\r\nThat is fine if, for example, you think the fiat system is imminently going to collapse but that is very unlikely. In all likelihood we’re going to need fiat for a while yet, and its relevance is illustrated by the fact that crypto’s value is expressed in fiat terms. So a crucial part of any trading or investing strategy is an exit point. \r\n\r\nThis is self-evident for short-term trading (as we’ll see in the next article) but for those that invest for the longer term - the Hodlers - it\'s worth deciding in advance if and when you take profit (should you make any) off the table.\r\n\r\nIt is great watching numbers go up during a bull market, you may even feel slightly disconnected from reality, but as soon as the market turns, and markets inevitably go through cycles, you may feel uncomfortable at not realising some profit. \r\n\r\n    Tip: For longer term investment set a price target then consider a 15/10 rule, cashing in 10% for every 15% gain.\r\n\r\nIf you cannot envisage yourself selling then think about other ways your investment can provide a return. You might apply the risk spectrum approach in turn to your crypto portfolio, keeping the bulk securely on your hard wallet, a portion earning return through Defi/Cefi and then taking greatest risk with the smallest proportion \r\n\r\nTo help here are some suggested cryptocurrency trading strategies, starting with the least complex and requiring only small, regular amounts.

You might use Standard charting tools  like Moving Averages, Relative Strength Index (RSI) or Bollinger Bands.\r\n\r\nYou might also rely on an external indicator to inform the adjustments, which you feel correlate with price, such as the US Dollar Index (DXY). \r\n\r\nThe DXY is a measure of the value of the US Dollar relative to a basket of currencies of major trading partners. It tends to have an inverse relationship with Bitcoin and the wider crypto markets, as dollar weakness pushes investors to look for assets that are a better store of value, such as Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nAny indicator or model can be used, it just depends on the value you feel it holds. The Stock-to-flow model created by Crypto Influencer, Plan B, is another popular tool.

(126, 'Step 4: How to use crypto', 'What are Smart Contracts?', 'How Smart Contracts work', 'Though inspired by Bitcoin, which functions as a new form of money, Ethereum was designed with much greater ambition. It provides a foundational layer for any digital application that can be reduced to mathematics, programmable money being just one use case, with Ether serving as Ethereum’s native currency. \r\n\r\nThis capability is known as being ‘Turing Complete’ and led to Ethereum’s description as the world’s computer. To provide this foundational layer, Ethereum has its own scripting language called Solidity, which is how Smart Contracts are written. The instructions are processed in a run-time environment known as the Ethereum Virtual Machine - the EVM for short. \r\n\r\nThere are two main types of Ethereum accounts:\r\n\r\nExternal users send/receive transactions using an Ethereum supported wallet like Meta Mask, and connect to Smart Contracts via a web browser and the user interface of an Ethereum supported application.\r\n\r\nContract accounts control Smart Contracts and use them to write state changes to the EVM. They connect with other Smart Contracts and External users.\r\n\r\nContract accounts now include a vast range of digital applications (dApps), building new types of permissionless economies on top of the Ethereum foundational layer. You’ll often hear these applications described as Protocols or Primitives. These names refer to the collective function of Smart Contracts and front-end applications like websites and mobile apps. We introduce examples below.\r\n\r\nThe EVM stores all Smart Contracts, and as Ethereum accounts interact with a Smart Contract the EVM will execute the requested change, and the most recent state is recorded in the Ethereum blockchain. \r\n\r\nThe Ethereum blockchain is a chain of blocks of data reflecting the state change of Accounts\r\n\r\nthat transfer value. As each block can only store a limited number of transactions, Ethereum charges a fee measured in GAS - denominated in Ether. Executing a transaction, therefore, requires GAS, which is paid for by the external user account that sends the transaction request to the Smart Contract. \r\n\r\nGAS fees are earned by Miners who compete to add verified blocks of transactions to the Ethereum blockchain using an energy-intensive Consensus Mechanism called Proof of Work.\r\n\r\nIn June 2022 an upgrade to Ethereum described as the Merge will see it transfer to an alternative Consensus Mechanism called Proof of Stake, reducing its energy consumption by 99.5%. \r\n\r\nIt is also designed to reduce the fees required to execute Smart Contracts that have ballooned due to Ethereum’s popularity within DEFI and NFTs - the most popular use cases for Smart Contracts.', 20),
(127, 'Step 4: How to use crypto', 'What are Smart Contracts?', 'Smart Contract Use Cases', 'Ethereum’s Turing Complete design means that anyone can write a Smart Contract, there is no submission or vetting process. Smart Contracts can create their own rules and ownership structures. Given that Ethereum also supports token standards, it is a blank canvas for new permissionless methods of generating and exchanging value.', 20),
(128, 'Step 4: How to use crypto', 'What are Smart Contracts?', 'Currencies & Token Systems', 'The inclusion of token standards was a masterstroke by Ethereum’s founder, Vitalik Buterin, because it allowed these new digital applications (dApps) the freedom to build their own mini-economies, with tokens for exchanging and creating value, as well seamlessly integrating with other applications through Smart Contracts - a concept called composability.\r\n\r\nThe most common Ethereum token standard is ERC-20. This set of guidelines allows developers to build applications with a unique token, which is interoperable with other products and services.\r\n\r\nThe ERC-20 standard specifically relates to fungible tokens within Ethereum and provides an API for tokens within Smart Contracts providing the following standard functions:\r\n\r\n* transfer tokens from one account to another\r\n* get the current token balance of an account\r\n* get the total supply of the token available on the network\r\n* approve whether an amount of token from an account can be spent by a third-party account\r\n\r\nWith a few extra lines of Smart Contract code, you can determine the supply, distribution and additional utility of a new fungible token. This ability opened the floodgate for alternative token systems to Ethereum and Bitcoin, commonly known as alternative coins (altcoins), and cryptocurrencies that are pegged to fiat currencies - Stablecoins - making them more appealing to traders and businesses.\r\n\r\nThere is also a standard for tokens that aren’t designed for exchange - non-fungible tokens (NFTs) - which Smart Contracts can apply to create in-game economies where users take ownership of what they create and earn within games, freely trading them outside of the game. \r\n\r\nPlay-to-earn is one of the fastest-growing areas of the Ethereum ecosystem, with Axie Infinity one of the most popular applications. It uses Ethereum’s Smart Contract capability to:\r\n\r\n* Create a token for trading within the game\r\n* Collect, breed and battle NFT based creatures called Axies\r\n* Allow players to have stake in the game through a governance token - SLP\r\n\r\nDecentralised Finance\r\n\r\nCombining Smart Contract capability with a common standard for exchanging value enabled the emergence of a new phenomenon known as DEFI (Decentralised Finance). In simple terms, DEFI uses Smart Contracts to offer financial services to the External Account holders of Ethereum and other ERC-20 tokens.\r\n\r\nSaving & Loans - Protocols like Compound use Smart Contracts to algorithmically offer interest on deposits and lend out funds against collateral. Compound alone has over $10bn in Ethereum based assets earning interest.\r\n\r\nDecentralised Exchanges - Smart Contracts enable Automated Market Making - automatically providing liquid pools of tradable asset pairs without any central process or oversight. A DEX will incentivise users to provide liquidity (LPs) and then use algorithms to provide constant pricing and balanced liquidity pools.\r\n\r\nDEX’s can also offer the same kind of complex derivatives trading offered by centralised exchanges but with much greater freedom, control and access to liquidity. dYdX and Uniswap are two of the most popular decentralised exchanges.\r\n\r\nYield Aggregation - Given the explosive growth in opportunities to generate a return from DEFI protocols, Smart Contract-based services will find the best strategies to optimise return, also known as Yield Farming.', 20),
(129, 'Step 4: How to use crypto', 'What are Smart Contracts?', 'The benefits of Smart Contracts', 'Nick Sazbo, one of crypto’s OGs, summed up the function of Smart Contracts\r\n\r\n“I call these new contracts “smart”, because they are far more functional than their inanimate paper-based ancestors. No use of artificial intelligence is implied. A smart contract is a set of promises, specified in digital form, including protocols within which the parties perform on these promises”\r\n\r\nDescribing traditional paper contracts as inanimate was a clever way of contrasting the restrictions with the analogue way of reaching an agreement, with the benefits of Smart Contracts. \r\n\r\nTransparency & Trust\r\n\r\nSmart Contracts increase trust as they are open and transparent and not lodged with an intermediary. Anyone can review the code and the logic to understand what will happen if an account interacts with it. \r\n\r\nReviewing Smart Contracts does, however, require technical know-how, and the creator of the Smart Contract won’t necessarily share their identity. Independent contract auditing is now a significant part of Smart Contract deployment. At the same time, there are also a growing number of off-the-shelf tools that can allow you to review Smart Contract function yourself.\r\n\r\nAutomation\r\n\r\nSmart Contracts are digital and based entirely on logical arguments; they can be executed automatically, saving both time and cost. With the added benefit of Ethereum’s composability, you can quickly build out connected Smart Contract based services like lego blocks.\r\n\r\nImmutable & Secure\r\n\r\nOne of the fears of entering into any traditional agreement is whether the terms will be honoured and how you can check. With Smart Contracts, anyone can check the outputs using blockchain browsers like Etherscan. The nature of blockchains means that transactions are immutable - they cannot be changed - providing a great deal of reassurance and security. \r\n\r\nFor the same reason, Smart Contract terns are secure and cannot be changed once committed to the EVM. But this is also a source of vulnerability, as we’ll now find out.', 20),
(130, 'Step 4: How to use crypto', 'What are Smart Contracts?', 'Disadvantages of Smart Contracts', 'One of the most significant downsides to the decentralised Smart Contract model is that they will automatically execute whatever logic is coded into them. Given Smart Contract code is developed by humans who are prone to error, this frequently includes unintended vulnerabilities. \r\n\r\nCode vulnerabilities are made worse by the common practice of copying Smart Contracts wholesale, including any broken logic.\r\n\r\nDEFI became one of the biggest sources of crypto scams in 2021 with Chainalysis estimating that $2.3bn was stolen from DEFI protocols. The increasing complexity of Smart Contracts and the interoperability of so many DEFI protocols will likely cause these vulnerabilities to increase exponentially.', 20),
(131, 'Step 4: How to use crypto', 'What are Smart Contracts?', 'Rival Smart Contract Blockchains', 'Ethereum was the first blockchain to introduce the concept of Smart Contracts, but there are now many rivals with their own scripting languages and chains built purposely to be EVM compatible.\r\n\r\nThe main reason for the rise of so-called Ethereum challengers isn’t any specific failure of Smart Contracts; rather the opposite, Ethereum has become a victim of its own success.\r\n\r\nSmart Contracts are so efficient and have opened so many opportunities that the capacity of the Ethereum blockchain to commit the state changes to new blocks cannot keep up. This has seen the price of Smart Contract transactions (the amount of GAS required) rise sharply, pricing many users out of the market.\r\n\r\nRivals to Ethereum such as Solana, Polkadot, Cardano and Avalanche have developed their own Smart Contract languages and different Consensus Mechanisms with faster block confirmation times to accommodate significantly more transactions at a fraction of the cost. Unfortunately, their solutions generally offer scalability by compromising decentralisation or security. \r\n\r\nSatisfying all those elements is what is known as the blockchain trilemma. Ethereum’s upcoming Merge and move to Proof of Stake is intended to address this, along with new approaches to processing transactions off-chain (using Rollups) then batching them to the main Ethereum chain to record the state change.', 20),

(133, 'Step 4: How to use crypto', 'Storing & securing your crypto', 'How to Store & Secure Cryptocurrency', 'As already described, cryptocurrency is a new type of money, and like any other money, your top priority is keeping it safe. With the money you are familiar with there are a couple of ways of looking after it.\r\n\r\n1. Look after it yourself \r\n2. Trust someone else to look after it on your behalf\r\n\r\nOption 1 might mean a safe or vault, with a key or code that only you hold. Option 2 - allowing someone else to look after it - most likely means using a bank, who you trust to store it, but gives you convenient access via an account, and maybe an App.\r\n\r\nWith cryptocurrency you have the same two options; you can assume full responsibility yourself, or trust someone else to look after it. The term you’ll see used for this is ‘custody’. So the two options become:\r\n\r\n1. Look after crypto yourself - Use a non-custodial crypto version of a safe\r\n2. Trust someone else to look after your crypto - Use a custodial service, crypto version of a bank\r\n\r\nAt this point it is important to understand exactly what is being custodied (looked after) as crypto is entirely digital, but its monetary units don\'t exist as files on your file or laptop. \r\n\r\nThis knowledge will enable you to choose from the different options for storage, which are listed below.', 21),
(134, 'Step 4: How to use crypto', 'Storing & securing your crypto', 'What Crypto Storage Really Means', 'To understand what cryptocurrency storage really means, let’s look at what you are used to and draw some useful comparisons:\r\n\r\n1. Digital banking\r\n\r\n - Access Tools\r\n\r\nYour banking App/online account are tools to access your money. They don’t actually store any money, but are a representation of the amount of money your bank holds on your behalf. \r\n\r\n- Access Credentials\r\n\r\nYou prove ownership of the funds held by your bank with credentials (such as personal details, biometrics, identity documentation, passwords, pins etc). This allows you to move or spend the money.\r\n\r\n- Account Details\r\n\r\nYour bank balance is tied to an account with unique criteria - sort code, account, IBAN - that enable you to spend and receive funds.\r\n\r\nCryptocurrency operates in a similar way, except there is no bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Crypto\r\n\r\n- Access Tools\r\n\r\nThe  equivalent of your banking App or online account is a crypto wallet, that you can access on your laptop or smartphone. The different varieties are listed below.\r\n\r\n- Access Credentials\r\n\r\nThe credential that proves ownership of crypto funds associated with an address is called a Private Key, which can be stored in a wallet. It is a long alphanumeric string as crypto operates with no personal details. Safely storing crypto boils down to keeping your Private Keys safe.\r\n\r\n- Account Details\r\n\r\nClever cryptography generates a version of your Private Key called a Public Key. The Public Key provides one way access only; someone can send you funds or view your address balance in a compressed version called a Public Address.\r\n\r\nThe public address is the equivalent of your sort code/account number. Your wallet will hold your Public Addresses which can be generated as QR codes.\r\n\r\nSo returning to our two storage options but with the understanding of what exactly is being stored:\r\n\r\n* Self-custody - You control your Private Keys & therefore your funds\r\n* Custody - You trust a 3rd party to look after your Private Keys & they give you access', 21),
(135, 'Step 4: How to use crypto', 'Storing & securing your crypto', 'Seeds - Usable Versions Of Private Keys', 'It is unrealistic to remember the 64 character Private Key for every address holding cryptocurrency, as it is not uncommon to have multiple addresses, in the same way you might have multiple bank accounts with different details. \r\n\r\nLuckily, wallet designs have evolved to solve this. Hierarchical Deterministic wallets - HD Wallets for short - can derive all Private Keys from one start point known as a Seed.\r\n\r\nA Seed is a string of between 12 and 24 unique phrases. These are taken from a list of 2,048 English words called the BIP39 standard. You may also see a Seed referred to as a Recovery Phrase or Backup Phrase. \r\n\r\nSo the fundamental difference between custodial and non-custodial wallets is whether you ultimately have access to the private keys/seed or not, giving you control over the funds.\r\n\r\nLooking at a crypto wallet, you cannot tell whether it is custodial or non-custodial (you have full responsibility). The ‘custody’ part works in the background, but is central to security.\r\n\r\nThis is so important because there is no bank, which means no customer support. So if you take the responsibility for your funds and something goes wrong, there is no chat support or complaints process.\r\n\r\nConversely, allowing a service to look after your funds puts a lot of faith in their security. Just as there is no safety net for you, there isn’t a fallback for the service looking after your Seed.\r\n\r\nThis is by design; cryptocurrency gives the individual power over their money, and as we know, with great power, comes great responsibility.\r\n\r\nWith the concept of custody in mind, we can now look at the options for safely storing cryptocurrency, by looking at the types of cryptocurrency wallet.', 21),

All the screenshots shown so far are of a Mobile Soft Wallet.\r\n\r\nRemember there are two approaches for custody (who ultimately looks after the funds) so Mobile Wallets will come in those flavours - custodial (the wallet provider controls the keys) or non-custodial (you are in control).\r\n\r\n- Web\r\nWhere a Mobile Crypto Wallet is the equivalent of your banking App, a Web Wallet functions in a similar way to accessing your bank account via a browser - such as through a laptop or tablet. It doesn’t need any software to be downloaded, just the entering of credentials, so compromises security for convenience.\r\n\r\nIt is probably the riskiest method to store crypto as well, as it exposes your wallet to multiple vulnerabilities. For instance, if your browser is compromised, someone else could be able to see all the information you might have saved like your username and password. If you lose the device you\'re browsing from, then the person in control of your device might also be able to access your stored login credentials.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, web wallets or online wallets should only ever be used when you require the service associated with the web wallet. For example, you will have to use an online service to sell your crypto, which will require you to deposit your crypto into the service\'s web wallet.\r\n\r\nAs you’ll see later in this section, buying and selling crypto will likely involve creating a web wallet with a service called a Cryptocurrency Exchange.\r\n\r\n- Desktop\r\nA Desktop Wallet is the pc equivalent of a Mobile Wallet in that it involves downloading an application and storing your Private Keys or Seed Phrase locally. \r\n\r\nYou can compare this to downloading a game rather than streaming it.

It is just an exchange of one currency for another at an agreed rate - e.g Euros for BTC (the currency symbol for bitcoin) - which is why the most common place to buy cryptocurrency is called an Exchange. \r\n\r\nIt might feel confusing when cryptocurrency like bitcoin is talked about as having a price, whereas for dollar, euro etc we are used to talking about an exchange rate. \r\n\r\nThese two terms - price/exchange rate - are interchangeable and simply reflect the fact that currency values - especially crypto - are constantly changing. \r\n\r\nWe dive into why that is in our section on Trading, but for this article,it is simply worth knowing that the price of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin doesn’t come from a single source.\r\n\r\nThe price simply reflects the interaction between buyers and sellers on each Exchange, which organically maintain parity with each other. (again explained in detail elsewhere). An overall representation of price can then be reached by aggregating the price from the main exchanges.', 23),
(159, 'Step 4: How to use crypto', 'Where you buy crypto', 'Choosing an Exchange', 'Given the growing popularity of cryptocurrency there are an increasing number of exchanges to choose from.\r\n\r\nYou\'ll find that even the most credible exchanges struggle when demand is particularly intense, so try and plan the process of choosing an exchange, rather than reacting to the next big price rise.\r\n\r\nTo make that decision easier we have summarised the key criteria and main operators, before providing a walk-through of what the first-time buying process will involve:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Security\r\nSecurity should always be the uppermost consideration in choosing an exchange. A quick Google search would, for example, establish if an exchange has ever been hacked, experienced significant downtime or has been subject to any legal sanction. \r\n\r\nAside from the security of the platform itself, look into how seriously they treat customer security and your personal data.\r\n\r\n2. Usability\r\nIf you are new to cryptocurrency choose an exchange that is focused specifically on helping you buy for the first time with ease. This means simple layouts and a great mobile experience. \r\n\r\nAvoid exchanges targeted at experienced traders. This should be obvious from their home page, where language should be simple and understandable with a clear focus on first-time buyers.\r\n\r\nAs you\'ll see in the next article, exchanges targeted at beginners will boil the buying process down to just a few clicks, just like a normal online purchase process. This removes a lot of the pain of buying crypto, but does compromise on the control you have over the exact price you buy it, and the fees you pay.\r\n\r\nSome exchanges cater to both newbies and pros with separate products e.g Coinbase and Coinbase Pro. Make sure you are using the basic service as the Pro site will assume a significant level of understanding.\r\n\r\n3. Fees\r\nAn exchange works as  a go-between, matching people who want to buy with people who want to sell; they charge a fee for facilitating the exchange. The size of that fee is calculated as a % of the amount you buy or sell. \r\n\r\nFees should be a key consideration in your choice if you are intending on making a significant volume of purchases. If you simply want to dip a toe in the water then fees will be less significant.\r\n\r\n4. Choice of cryptocurrencies\r\nIf you are buying cryptocurrency for the first time, the likelihood is you are buying bitcoin or ethereum.\r\n\r\nShould you, however, have a specific alt coin (alternative coin) in mind, or think it likely you’ll want to diversify, make sure to choose an exchange with a broad enough range of cryptocurrencies. The are literally thousands.\r\n\r\nThe process exchanges use in adding differing cryptocurrencies varies greatly, so you’ll find a big difference in the availability. If you want to trade a niche crypto, check its availability in advance.\r\n\r\n5. Localisation\r\nOne of the biggest factors in your choice should be based on how much the exchange is tailored to your local needs. Is the site translated? Does it provide relevant local payment options? Are there country restrictions specific to where you live?\r\n\r\n6. Trust\r\nBuying cryptocurrency is exciting and empowering, but isn’t without risk. Make sure to use an exchange that is trustworthy. Referrals from friends are a good practice, as is researching on Google, App Stores Social Media and Reddit. Avoid promoted reviews and try to find genuine opinions.', 23),
(160, 'Step 4: How to use crypto', 'Where you buy crypto', 'How an Exchange Account works ', 'Though cryptocurrency itself is decentralised - as explained in our basics of cryptocurrency section - the standard model for exchanges is a centralised one, which is why you’ll see the acronym CEX - Centralised Exchange. \r\n\r\nThis is a big point of debate within the crypto community because using a CEX is a custodial option - remember ‘Not your keys, not your coins.’\r\n\r\nAs part of the process of creating an account with an Exchange you automatically get a web wallet (jump to this article for more information). This is like an online bank account or App where you can check your balance in fiat (Euro/Dollar etc) which hopefully increases over time. \r\n\r\nAny cryptocurrency held in your new exchange wallet is in the custody of the exchange which is why Security should be a huge consideration in the process of choosing an exchange. Ensure you follow best practice for securing your exchange wallet is also crucially important.\r\n\r\nYour cryptocurrency exchange wallet will allow you to do the following, which were covered in the previous article in this section:\r\n\r\n- Send your crypto to another person/service\r\n- Receive crypto from another person/service\r\n\r\nThe trading features of your cryptocurrency exchange account will allow you to:\r\n\r\n- Buy cryptocurrency\r\n- Convert your crypto for other available currencies\r\n- Sell & Withdraw\r\n\r\nAll of those are covered in the next article.', 23),

They have visible management teams and 24/7 customer service. In fact you’ll soon be able to buy shares in Coinbase the same as Facebook or Apple.\r\n\r\nAs already explained, using a CEX also means they custody (look after) your crypto until you decide to move the funds to a non custodial wallet.\r\n\r\nFor those unwilling to compromise there is another option the DEX (Decentralised Exchange).\r\n\r\nAs the name suggests, decentralised exchanges aren’t located in any one location and don’t follow a traditional account based approach.\r\n\r\nInstead DEXs facilitate access to liquidity (buyers & sellers) via applications that themselves are just smart contracts, with no specific geographic location and therefore, can’t (right now) be subject to any set of regulations around things like KYC.\r\n\r\nUsing a DEX means you are not only responsible for custody of your funds, but there is a lot more you’ll need to understand in order to buy and sell.\r\n\r\nUsability and complexity make DEX’s inappropriate for beginners but even more importantly a DEX is crypto-to-crypto only.

(169, 'Step 5: How to build crypto', 'What is Bitcoin\'s architecture?', 'Architecture of the existing monetary system', 'Existing monetary systems are known as fiat money. Fiat is a latin term that means \'by decree\' and it is used to describe how currencies such as the US Dollar, Euro and Yen are created and managed. \r\n\r\nSince 1971 global currencies have only had value because the governments that issue them say so. They are not backed by any asset, such as gold - which was previously the case - and work on a trust-based model.\r\n\r\n    Read more about how fiat banking works\r\n\r\nAnyone using fiat money must trust a central authority to establish the rules of the monetary system and how they are enforced. This can broadly be broken down into:\r\n\r\n1. A monetary framework & settlement system - Rules & policy; infrastructure to issue new money & achieve consensus on transaction settlement.\r\n2. System hierarchy - Assigning different levels of privilege to different participants to implement the framework and settlement function - internally and externally.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the system hierarchy (2) is some kind of governing body that sets the rules of the overall framework (rules and policy) and oversees/delegates the settlement system  (1).\r\n\r\nIn the real world, this is the government who generally delegates that power to a central bank to enforce the policy, issue new money and manage a settlement system, while various regulators try to keep the system in check.  \r\n\r\nDifferent privileges to interact with the monetary system cascade down a network hierarchy to banks, payment services, and on to individual users of money - merchants & consumers. \r\n\r\nDesigning a digital monetary system that can reliably work without the need for a central mediator is hard because of something known as the Byzantine General’s Problem. \r\n\r\nThis is an allegory of a Byzantine General who needs to make a decision in battle when he knows he cannot rely on the accuracy of everyone giving him information about the state of battle. So in relation to systems, this problem is agreeing on a course of action where information is incomplete or unreliable. \r\n\r\nIn specific relation to a monetary system, the problem is what is known as a ‘Double Spend’ - the chance that a balance can be spent more than once. \r\n\r\nThe Double Spend problem undermines trust in a financial system and therefore justifies the need for a central authority to have the final word - to be the general - but at the same time, that central authority creates a point of weakness because of the power they wield.\r\n\r\nIn the case of fiat money, that weakness has resulted in the abuse of the power that governments have over the money supply, creating more and more of it.

No central authority enforces the rules; participants in the Bitcoin network follow them because of economic incentives provided for issuing Bitcoin at a predictable and unchangeable rate toward a maximum fixed supply. This removes the risk of monetary abuse and generates ongoing consensus on balances, solving the double spend problem. \r\n\r\nThe key rules of Bitcoin’s monetary system can be summarised as:\r\n- There is a fixed supply schedule of bitcoin towards a maximum of 21 million\r\n- The rate at which bitcoins are created toward that maximum amount is fixed mathematically - halving every four years\r\n- New bitcoins are created roughly every ten minutes (currently set at 6,25); the system is self-regulating to ensure this\r\n- There is no other way that bitcoin can be created', 25),

This isn’t unique to Bitcoin, but is an external cryptographic standard, developed by the NSA.\r\n\r\nA hash is a unique one-way identifier for a digital record that enables privacy and security. Think of it as a randomising engine. You provide any input, like a password and the algorithm produces a random string of text and numbers (the hash) of uniform length. Change one letter of the input and you get a different hash and you cannot work back from the hash to know the password, but a unique input will always generate the same hash value.\r\n\r\nSHA256 - used for Bitcoin Mining - produces a hash that is 64 characters long, regardless of the size of the input; each character represents four bytes of data 64*4=256.\r\n\r\nBitcoin mining is often described as a lottery because the task that Miners complete to show Proof of Work is arbitrary - it is just a clever way of regulating new block production and bitcoin issuance.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the game is to hash specific details from the new block and previous block, to produce a separate numeric hash value that is less than or equal to something called the Target - given our Lottery analogy this is the winning number.\r\n\r\nThe hashed block details are: version number, a timestamp, the hash from the previous block, the hash of something called the Merkle Root, a random number called a nonce, and a target hash.\r\n\r\nGiven the potential number range that a 256 bit algorithm can generate it will take a lot of guesses to find the Target, so all Miners do is run the algorithm as often as possible.\r\n\r\nIn the early days, Bitcoin could be mined using the GPU - Graphics Processing Unit  - in an ordinary home computer, originally designed to speed up the rendering of graphics, especially in PC gaming. \r\n\r\nToday, Miners use specialist hardware, known as mining rigs, that use application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs. These are computer processors that have been optimised to solve the maths problem that is at the heart of bitcoin mining. One of the most popular is the Antman S19j Pro Miner 100 TH/s made by Bitmain. \r\n\r\nMining facilities will run as many rigs as they can financially support and cool to find solve the puzzle before another Miner, somewhere else in the world, does. \r\n\r\nOnce the Target is found, the block - and its transactions - are added to the blockchain, which syncs with all Full Nodes and Miners, and the process starts again..\r\n\r\nWe highlighted above how Full Nodes adjust to regulate block creation, this accounts for any increase or decrease in the collective Mining capacity. That will logically vary in relation to the price of bitcoin, as that determines the value of the incentive for participating - the coinbase reward plus fees. \r\n\r\nBitcoin Price, the known difficulty rate, the collective hashrate and the cost of running a Mining operation (energy/cooling/overheads) can be used to work out the viability of participating.\r\n\r\nHash rate is a proxy for the strength of the Bitcoin network, as a bad actor would need to control 51% of the collective hash rate to stand any chance of being able to decide which transactions are added to new blocks and double spending coins.\r\n\r\nIt should also be obvious why Bitcoin Mining is so energy intensive given mining rigs are running 24/7/365 to find the Target, which gets harder as the aggregate hashing power goes up. This creates a virtuous loop with price, which tends to increase as hashrate increases, in turn attracting more Miners.', 29),

Bitcoin Mining is now a professional enterprise with most of the world’s bitcoin mining centres situated close to renewable energy sources in regions where electricity is cheap and plentiful.\r\n\r\nProfessional miners overclock their machines, to run them at performance levels above the manufacturer’s recommended settings. This should only be attempted by experienced miners, since care must be taken not to overheat the miners in the process, as solving one problem then creates another - the need to cool your mining operation, using up even more energy.\r\n\r\nSo unless you happen to own your own hydro electric dam or have a huge bank of solar panels, you will struggle to profitably mine bitcoin using GPUs or ASICs on a hobby basis.\r\n\r\nEven with multiple ASICs linked together, you could toil away for weeks, months or longer and fail to discover a new block. In the meantime, you would be running up an expensive electricity bill, given the power requirements and need to mitigate the heat generated.\r\n\r\nTo solve this problem, and make mining more accessible to as many people as possible, bitcoiners have created Mining Pools. This entails a group of miners combining their hashpower (their collective computer processing power) to search for a new block together.\r\n\r\nIf any miner in the pool succeeds in this quest, the coinbase reward will be shared with all pool members proportionately to their hashpower.\r\n\r\nIf you are determined to mine cryptocurrency, you’ll need to find the right location in which to set up a rig (cool, well vented, and well insulated or isolated to prevent noise complaints), and choose the right ASIC for your needs and budget. With that done, and your mining gear on its way, it’ll be time to consider which mining pool to join.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you provide 5% of the hash power to the pool and the pool discovers a new block, you will receive 5% of the reward which (excluding pool fees) would amount to 0.3125 BTC. \r\n\r\nIt sounds like easy money, but if it was that easy, everyone would be doing it!

You’ll also want to check the payout frequency; some pools will only pay out on scheduled dates, or once a minimum amount of BTC has been accrued in your wallet.\r\n\r\nPools that custody the miners’ rewards until they are distributed also incur a risk, since you are relying on them not to get hacked or hold onto funds.

The Ethereum Blockchain', 'Agreement on the accuracy of transactions stored in the blockchain is reached through a consensus mechanism called Proof of Work, copying the general approach taken by Bitcoin, but with specific adaptations that make a significant difference to Ethereum’s tokenomics - how ETH is created, distributed and incentivises owners . \r\n\r\nMining Nodes run a specific algorithm called EthHash, an arbitrary mathematical calculation that produces new blocks of the state changes every fifteen seconds, giving a reward of two Ethereum to the Miner that produces a ‘certificate of legitimacy’ proving the required work has been completed, along with the fees paid by Accounts and dApps for transactions and Smart Contract execution.\r\n\r\nThe new block will be broadcast to the rest of the Network, and once other Miners see the certificate of legitimacy they must accept it as being the latest block in the chain.\r\n\r\nThe timing of blocks is set by the Protocol and the difficulty adjusted programmatically to keep block production time consistent.\r\n\r\nBlocks are limited in size based on the amount Gas required to execute all transactions. The upper limit is set at 30 million Gas, but block size will vary depending on demand.\r\n\r\nEthereum’s use of Proof of Work is planned to end in 2022, changing to Proof of Stake, in order to improve scalability and to address concerns around the environmental impact of Proof of Work mining. \r\n\r\nA separate Beacon Chain already exists, holding staked funds, which will eventually merge with the mainnet and apply a new consensus mechanism called Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget.', 30),
(192, 'Step 5: How to build crypto', 'What is Ethereum\'s architecture?', '4. Ether & its tokenomics', 'Unlike Bitcoin, the supply of Ethereum is uncapped, growing via the reward of two ETH paid to Miners for producing new blocks. \r\n\r\nTransactions are paid for by the sender in something called Gas. By charging for the work done by the EVM it incentives the minimum amount of calculation and charges the sender.\r\n\r\nGas is paid for in Gwei, which as a micro-unit of Ether makes fees much easier to represent.\r\n\r\n1 ETH = 1,000,000,000 Gwei.\r\n\r\nIn response to the concerns around Ethereum\'s inflationary tokenomics changes were made to the Mining process through an Ethereum Improvement Proposal, EIP1559, implemented on August 5th, 2021.\r\n\r\nThe changes mean that a portion of the fees which are included in newly mined blocks are burned, rather than going to Miners. The objective is to burn enough ETH on a regular basis to decrease the supply, and turn into a deflationary coin.\r\n\r\nThe imminent changes to the Consensus Method mentioned above are already impacting Ethereum’s tokenomics by providing tangible incentives for ETH holders to stake their funds and support the network. \r\n\r\nAt present close to 8% of ETH’s circulating supply is locked in the ETH2 Deposit Contract, equivalent to 9.25 million tokens or about $23bn, making it the largest single ETH holder in existence.\r\n\r\n    $23bn\r\n    The value locked in Ethereum\'s Proof of Stake deposit contract', 30),
(193, 'Step 5: How to build crypto', 'What is Ethereum\'s architecture?', '5. Smart Contracts, dApps & Gas', 'Smart Contracts are written in a programming language specific to Ethereum, called Solidity, which for anyone with a programming background (especially Javascript) shouldn’t present a huge challenge to learn.\r\n\r\n    “I call these new contracts “smart”, because they are far more functional than their inanimate paper-based ancestors. No use of artificial intelligence is implied. A smart contract is a set of promises, specified in digital form, including protocols within which the parties perform on these promises” — Nick Szabo, 1996\r\n\r\nSmart Contracts are stored within the EVM, with their latest state reflected in the most recent block in the Ethereum blockchain.\r\n\r\nA few lines of code within a Smart Contract can create a new cryptocurrency or financial service, so long as certain basic standards are followed. The standardisation within the Ethereum Protocol enables interoperability between dApps and is one of the reasons why the market for DEFI and NFTs has grown so rapidly in such a short period of time.\r\n\r\nThousands of dApps now run on Ethereum, while other blockchains are trying to imitate and improve on Ethereum’s design, offering similar Smart Contract functionality and providing EVM compatibility so that applications can be easily ported.\r\n\r\nThe increasing use of Smart Contracts has made Ethereum a victim of its own success as the execution fees users have to pay to engage with DEFI services or mint NFTs are pricing out the average user.', 30),

Ethereum Nodes', 'Like Bitcoin, Ethereum’s network features different types of Node fulfilling the required functions of the Ethereum Protocol. You can think of Node as a computer which requires Client Software to function.\r\n\r\nWe’ll summarise the basics of Nodes and Clients, then look at each in more detail in dedicated articles:\r\n\r\nFull Nodes\r\n\r\n- Run the Ethereum client software\r\n- Store the entire blockchain record of transactions\r\n- Validate blocks & all states.\r\n- Propagate transactions & store them for miners to pick up\r\n- Can function as a Miner to verify blocks & issue new Ether\r\n\r\nMiner\r\n\r\n-  A Miner must be a Full Node but a Full Node doesn’t need to be a Miner\r\n- Runs the EthHash algorithm to show Proof of Work\r\n- Verifies transactions in new blocks\r\n- Gets rewarded with ETH for every block mined plus transaction fees\r\n\r\nLight node\r\n\r\n- Stores a portion of the blockchain\r\n- Can validate transactions based on the portion of blockchain stored\r\n- Useful for low capacity devices like mobile phones not suited for storing Gigagytes of data\r\n\r\nArchive node\r\n\r\n- Everything stored in the full node plus an archive of historical states\r\n- Can amount to Terabytes of data so only suitable for enterprise level users\r\n\r\nEthereum’s move to Proof of Stake will implement something called sharding, a method to improve the efficiency of transaction processing, and reduce the overall size of the Ethereum blockchain which is so much larger than Bitcoin given the requirement to store all state changes.', 30),

Ethereum Clients & Networks', 'The Client Software is an implementation of the Ethereum Protocol, providing a formal specification for how the Ethereum network and blockchain functions. It is available in a variety of different languages and with different approaches to how it syncs with the rest of the network.\r\n\r\nAt present running an Archive or Full Node takes several days for a full synchronisation and requires significant storage capacity. This can put running a node outside the reach of someone with technical abilities and resources, which some people argue compromises Ethereum’s decentralisation. You can get around that issue by using Node Client Services that run the infrastructure for you and simply provide an API .', 30),
(196, 'Step 5: How to build crypto', 'What is Ethereum\'s architecture?', 'Different Ethereum Networks', 'The Ethereum Protocol is open source software so it doesn’t necessarily need to apply to the main the Ethereum network which is known as the Mainnet. \r\n\r\nThere are different implementations for testing - Ropsten - or bespoke product applications (as shown in the table above).\r\n\r\nEach network operates independently so the balance and transaction history of an Ethereum account on the Mainnet will not apply to other networks. Users simply need to connect to the different networks within their wallets, such as MetaMask.', 30),
(197, 'Step 5: How to build crypto', 'What is Ethereum\'s architecture?', 'Different Sync Strategies', 'One of the reasons why there are different Ethereum Clients is that each takes a slightly different approach to syncing with the rest of the network to download the latest version of the blockchain. They will offer different features and be lighter or heavier in terms of their application size.', 30),
(198, 'Step 5: How to build crypto', 'What is Ethereum\'s architecture?', '8.Types of Ethereum account', 'Though the Bitcoin blockchain supports a monetary system individual users don’t have accounts, balances are represented through Unspent Transactions (UTXOs). Ethereum differs on this point as it does operate a distinct Account structure:\r\n\r\n- External Account - A user with a public address/key stored in a wallet\r\n\r\n- Contract Account - Created when a Smart Contract is created, using the address of the creator and the number of transactions sent, and controlled by the code within the Smart Contract.\r\n\r\nAll accounts have a balance, displayed in Ether which simply send Ether back and forth, or a specific payload (binary data), which is sent to a contract account with code, and provides an input for executions.', 30),
(199, 'Step 5: How to build crypto', 'What is Ethereum\'s architecture?', '9. Ethereum Standards', 'One of the most forward thinking aspects of the Ethereum Protocol are the clearly defined standards which enable interoperability across all the dApps that the EVM supports. These standards have been replicated across layer 1 networks that seek to replicate its function.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the most common:\r\n\r\n- ERC-20 - A standard for fungible (interchangeable) tokens, like virtual currencies, which can also be used to give holders voting rights in DAOs.\r\n\r\n- ERC-721 - A standard interface for non-fungible (unique) tokens, like a collectible, one-off digital asset or deed of ownership.\r\n\r\n- ERC-777 - A standard that enables you to build additional functionality on top of tokens such as creating more transaction privacy or a recovery tool if you lose your private keys.\r\n\r\n- ERC-1155 - A multi-token standard that can do the same things as an ERC-20, or ERC-721 token, but additionally enables movement of batches of tokens, calling balances of collections or approving a group of tokens to a single address.', 30),
(200, 'Step 5: How to build crypto', 'What is Ethereum\'s architecture?', 'What are the opportunities to build within Ethereum?', 'The genius of Vitalik Buterin was recognising that for a trustless cryptocurrency ecosystem to grow it needed a common language and a common set of economic standards. By providing this Ethereum does all the heavy lifting for supporting creators of digital applications, you just have to come up with a problem that will benefit from a decentralised solution, and use Solidity to express it mathematically within a Smart Contract, which includes:\r\n\r\n- Creating your own Currency\r\n- Creating a dApp\r\n\r\nIf you aren’t a creator but would rather help maintain the Ethereum ecosystem there are several clear options:\r\n\r\n- Becoming a validator in the new Proof of Stake Ethereum blockchain\r\n- Staking Ethereum to a pool run by a validator\r\n- Running an Ethereum Node\r\n\r\nIf you don’t want to run a Node you can use one of the existing APIs and build value-added services for Ethereum users:\r\n\r\n- Wallets, block explorers, analytics tools, fee estimators', 30);

However, this ban was later lifted by the Supreme Court of India in March 2020.\r\n\r\nSince then, there have been various discussions and debates regarding the regulation of cryptocurrency in India.
